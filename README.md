# Video Sharing through WebRTC

## Overview

This project is a video sharing application built using WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) technology. WebRTC enables real-time communication between web browsers and mobile applications, allowing for peer-to-peer audio, video, and data sharing without the need for plugins or external software.

## Features

### 1. Real-time Video Streaming

Our application leverages WebRTC to facilitate real-time video streaming between users. Whether you want to conduct a virtual meeting, share a live event, or simply connect with friends, our platform ensures low-latency and high-quality video communication.

### 2. Peer-to-Peer Communication

WebRTC establishes a direct connection between users, enabling peer-to-peer communication. This decentralized approach minimizes latency and enhances the overall user experience, especially in scenarios where instant interaction is crucial.
